			<h2>Cybersickness EEG research</h2>
			<p>
				I am working under Dr. Sharif Mohammad Shahnewaz Ferdous’ research in which we are trying to use EEG scans to understand what patterns in the brain indicate cybersickness and see how specific cybersickness mitigation strategies affect those brain patterns.

			<h2>VR Mocap Sports Training Research</h2>
			<p> For this mentored research at TCNJ I am trying to find out how camera-based motion capture and Virtual Reality can be used for sports training purposes. The goal is to see if this method of training can properly teach users without a personal coach and increase sports training accessibility.  </p>

			<h2>Verizon Internship</h2>
			<p> During my Internship at Verizon, I got to work with the Emerging Technologies team. Over my 10 weeks, I ported a VR game to their new AR device. By doing this project I learned how to use Snapdragon Spaces and MRTK3 in the Unity Engine. I also wrote a report on the viability of porting similar content. </p>

			<h2>CHI 2023 Workshop Paper</h2>
			<p>I had the opportunity to present my paper at CHI 2023 at the “Towards an Inclusive and Accessible Metaverse” workshop. The paper I wrote wrote with along with Dr. Sharif Mohammad Shahnewaz Ferdous, and Alex Quezada is called “Children in virtual reality deserves more attention”. This paper is a literary review in which we read 191 articles that involved children using virtual reality to see how they measured and prevented cybersickness. Our results showed only 11 studies had a proper questionnaire for children. </p>

			<h2>2022 Hackdown Project</h2>
			<p> For the hackathon, my group decided to make a website to help fix and prevent office pain. If a person has a specific ache or pain they can click on the body part to watch a video that shows stretches that can relieve the pain. We also implemented a Twillio API to text the user the stretches to their phone. We won the categories: Best Healthcare Hack, Most Creative Use of Twilio, and Best Use of Microsoft Cloud.</p>

			<h2>VR office productivity research</h2>
			<p>I did research at the TCNJ on how to make virtual reality viable for office space. I worked on finding device that works as both a mouse for virtual displays and a remote to interact with the virtual environment. </p>

			<h2>S&box VR map remaster</h2>
			<p>I am porting and remastering a map from the game Garry's mod to S&box. I’m converting the map from the Source Engine to the Source 2 Engine and updating the map with new textures and implementing VR support.</p>

			<h2>2022 Hack TCNJ Project</h2>
			<p>For my first hackathon, my group decided to make an app that is able to create a card deck for the mobile game Clash Royale. Our goal was to have the app create a deck that had the highest odds to beat a deck given to it. Our code takes in data from the Clash Royale API. It then uses machine learning to create a model based on almost 400,000 games to figure out which cards counter other ones.  </p>

			<h2>Stock Growth Comparator</h2>
			<p> This app takes any two stocks that can be seen on Yahoo Finance and displays a new candlestick chart based on the rate of change of the two stocks chosen by the user. This allows a user to visualize how a stock’s growth compares to the overall market’s growth, industry growth, or a competitor’s growth.  </p>

			<h2>2D Knapsack algorithm in C++</h2>
			<p>A partner and I are attempting to make a 2D knapsack algorithm from scratch in C++. A 2D knapsack algorithm attempts to put the best subset of rectangles into a larger rectangle to either fill the most space or have the most profitable set of items. </p>
